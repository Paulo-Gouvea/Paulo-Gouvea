- Hello There! :wave: <br /> 

My name is Paulo Matheus de Paula Barreto GouvÃªa. At the moment I have been studying to become a full stack developer. I have been using React, Next, Styled-Components and others technologies in the front-end, Node.JS, postgres and typeorm in the back-end and React Native and expo for mobile. I also used technologies like api fetch, contexts for state management and firebase for back-end. I also studying Flutter (dart) and Android (kotlin) to increase my stack.<br /> <br /> 

- About Me :house:	<br /> 

I am a person who likes to study more and more about technology so that I can develop applications that can help me become a better developer. I am also a fan of video games, good food (especially sweets) and always learning something new. <br /> <br />

Right now I do not have any professional experience but I did some personal projects like a Weather forecast app, a basic pokedex app and some React.JS and React Native projects I did in bootcamps.
