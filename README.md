- Hello There! :wave: <br /> 

My name is Paulo Matheus de Paula Barreto GouvÃªa. At the moment I have been studying to become a mobile developer. I have been using React Native for application development and using technologies like expo, typescript, styled-components and firebase in my projects.  I've also started to learn about flutter to increase my range of technologies.<br /> <br /> 

- About Me :house:	<br /> 

I am a person who likes to study more and more about technology so that I can develop applications that can help me become a better developer. I am also a fan of video games, good food (especially sweets) and always learning something new. <br /> <br />

- Technologies :computer: :keyboard:		<br /> 

As I said before I have experience with the React Native framework since 2021. I already used expo, typescript, styled-components, contexts for state control, external APIs, git and now I'm starting to use firebase. I've also started working with flutter to increase my range of technologies for mobile development.  <br /> 

In the past I have also used html, css (also used css frameworks like bootstrap and bulma), javascript, React.JS, Next.JS, Chakra.ui on the front-end. <br />

I also used node.js on the back-end and technologies like docker and postgress but it was very temporary. <br /> <br />
